# Authentication
# Django takes user and password and verifies user exists in DB
# And creates a user object model so it can be used by the application
# Django user object is a table in the DB created when migrate command
# tables names are "auth_user", "auth_group", "auth_permissions"

# Authorization: what actions can be performed on a model
# A user belongs to a group and a group can have multiple permissions
# A user can also be mapped to multiple permissions
